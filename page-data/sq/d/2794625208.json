Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.","taster_name":"Paul Gregutt","taster_twitter_handle":"@paulgwineÂ ","price":65,"designation":"Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block","variety":"Pinot Noir","region_1":"Willamette Valley","region_2":"Willamette Valley","province":"Oregon","country":"US","winery":"Sweet Cheeks"},{"points":"87","title":"Tandem 2011 Ars In Vitro Tempranillo-Merlot (Navarra)","description":"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish.
